# Streaming Media Component Testbed

## Description

  This is mainly a location to try small projects, likely early based on online tutorials or homework from class, to learn how to serve media files as a major component of any modern website is to efficently serve Media in all it's forms, from photo, to audio, to video. Eventually I would like to be able to emit livestream audio/video as I learn more as it pertains to WebSocket.

### Video of Usage

   just a scratchpad for now for me, but publically accessible for others to steal/borrow/copy from, as this itself is borrowed heavily from the following tech blog tutorial [How To Code a Video Streaming Server using Node.js](https://dev.to/abdisalan_js/how-to-code-a-video-streaming-server-using-nodejs-2o0)
